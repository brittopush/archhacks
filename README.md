==========================================
This is a repository that provides a complete walkthrough of how to build a
M.E.A.N web application.

Pfizer's data visualization problem served as an inspiration to this project at ArchHacks'16. Our hackathon submission can be viewed at https://devpost.com/software/pfrecords.
